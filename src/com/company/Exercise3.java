/*
1. Create a new program called Time.java. From now on, we wonâ€™t remind you to start with a small, working program,
    but you should.
2. Following the example program in Section 2.4, create variables named hour, minute, and second. Assign values that
    are roughly the current time. Use a 24-hour clock so that at 2:00 PM the value of hour is 14.
3. Make the program calculate and display the number of seconds since midnight.
4. Calculate and display the number of seconds remaining in the day.
5. Calculate and display the percentage of the day that has passed. You might run into problems when computing
    percentages with integers, so consider using floating-point.
6. Change the values of hour, minute, and second to reflect the current time. Then write code to compute the elapsed
    time since you started working on this exercise.
